## Files and Descriptions
* ASHI2024_poster_Wang_4117808.pdf: Poster in PDF format
* AH_*.xlsx: Supplementary tables of Ancestral Haplotypes for HLA-C to HLA-DQB1, HLA-V to HLA-DQB1, and HLA-F to HLA-DQB1 respectively
* PFB_*.xlsx: Supplementary tables of Polymorphic Frozen Block haplotypes for the MHC Alpha (HLA-V to HLA-J), Beta (HLA-C to MICA), and Delta (HLA-DRB345 to HLA-DQB1) blocks respectively

Commentary:

* Ancestral Haplotype/Conserved Extended Haplotype (AH/CEH) definitions and designations follow the format of Degli-Esposti et al, 1992, Hum Immunol. *
* 
* AH/CEH designation is assigned if the same haplotype is identified in 3 x unrelated individuals (Consensus is required for "Ancestral Haplotype").*
* 
* "OLI" allele designations (eg K*OLI3) refer to novel alleles we identified in this study.*
* 
* Putative AH/CEH shaded yellow was identified in this study. Non-shaded AH/CEH was described by Cattley et al, 2000, Eur J Immunogenet.*
* 
* 1KGP Population groups AFR = AFRICAN (n = 603), AMR = AMERICAN (n = 405), EUR = EUROPEAN (n = 321), EAS = EAST ASIAN (n = 213), SAS = SOUTH ASIAN (n = 255).*
