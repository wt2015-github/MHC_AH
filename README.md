Commentary:
** Ancestral Haplotype/Conserved Extended Haplotype (AH/CEH) definitions and designations follow the format of Degli-Esposti et al, 1992, Hum Immunol
AH/CEH designation is assigned if the same haplotype is identified in 3 x unrelated individuals 
(Consensus is required for the definition of "Ancestral Haplotype" )

Putative AH/CEH shaded yellow were identified in this study. 
Non-shaded AH/CEH were described by Cattley et al, 2000, Eur J Immunogenet

"Counts" refer to the numbers of times the haplotype was identified in apparently unrelated parents in the Thousand Genomes Project Trios
There were 599 trio's (XXXX apparently unrelated parents)
Population groups AFR = AFRICAN (n= ), AMR = AMERICAN (n = ), EAS = EAST ASIAN (n= ), SAS = SOUTH ASIAN (n=), EUR = EUROPEAN (n = )
"OLI" allele designations (eg K*OLI3) refer to novel alleles identified by us in this study
